# Final Phase
Welcome to the final phase ofs CSAW ESC'20! This page will provide additional details about the final challenges. There is one simple rule for solving the challenges:

1.  **Your solution should work with the provided .hex files**. Essentially, this means that you cannot modify the instructions in the .hex files to execute a different algorithm, print different messages, or implement your own programs. Some challenges are deterministic and others are dynamic; for the deterministic challenges, provided solutions should work on the organizersâ€™ boards, whereas for the dynamic challenges, you must provide sufficient evidence to show that the challenge was indeed solved (i.e. source code, screenshots, output messages from the challenge, etc.). At the ESC finals, the judges and challenge organizers will replicate, verify and evaluate the submitted solutions of the teams on a separate 'judge' board that will be programmed with the .hex files from this repository.


## Challenge Structure Overview

Throughout the next few weeks **several challenge sets will be released**. Each set will contain independent challenges for the teams to solve and all points from all challenges will be accumulated in the final score of each team. Challenges will be given a different number of points based upon their difficulties; the number of points for each challenge is revealed once the challenge is solved. These points will be awarded to each team when the submitted solutions are verified by the judges and the organizers.

## Final Report Results and Verifying Solutions

When submitting the final report, each team should also upload a .zip file with all scripts used to solve the challenges (if used) as well as the correct inputs necessary to solve the challenges. In this case, each of your scripts should have the same name as the challenge it solves. These files and inputs will be used to verify that a team solved each challenge correctly. 

The challenge leaders and judges will verify the solutions that each team has submitted before the day of the finals. On the day of the finals, each team should have a computer with all necessary files along with their HiFive1 Rev B board. The judges can further ask teams to present their solution for a challenge on the day of the finals.
